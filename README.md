# Sight-of-the-blind

PROBLEM
Blind are always out of the main stream because of their incapability to see objects around  them .This makes their life quite challenging and difficult for them  to perform their daily chores .We are aiming to help blind people see through our blind assistance device. 

SOLUTION
The device consists of a camera mounted on the head of the blind with the help of a eyeglasses . 
The real time video is refined and processed using Image Processing            ( OpenCV ). 
The pixel values of each and every pixel in the real time video is obtained by further processing of the video and are transferred to a microcontroller board which converts it into electrical pulses.
The electrical pulses are transmitted to brain of the blind through very mild electrical shocks given through a grid put on the skin of the blind .
    ( The grid consists of same number of cells as the number of pixels in the video. The grid gives very mild shocks 			of intensity corresponding to the pixel values.) 
This will help the blind see through his/her skin !!
